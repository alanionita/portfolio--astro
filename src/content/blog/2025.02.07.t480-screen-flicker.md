It's unclear to me why, but Linux Mint 22.1 on the T480 causes screen flickering. 

To experience the issue check the login screen once the laptop has come out of suspend, or open a dock applet and pause on a dropdown for a long time. 

Issue seems to be related to transparency and screen sleep.

## How to Fix 

1. Check that `mesa-utils` package is installed 

```shell
apt list | grep "mesa-utils"
```

Install the package if not present

2. Add this file to X11 config

Open the X11 config directory

```shell
cd /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
```

Create the `20-intel.conf` within the above directory, with the following contents

```shell
Section "Device"
 Identifier "Intel Graphics"
 Driver "Intel"
 Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
 Option "TearFree" "true"
EndSection
```

3. Restart the computer

You can also fix it by installing KDE Plasma :P /s
